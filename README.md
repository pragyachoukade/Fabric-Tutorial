# Microsoft Fabric Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my hands-on learning repository documenting Microsoft Fabric. This project highlights my end-to-end workflows: data ingestion, transformation, semantic modeling, governance, and deployments.

## ðŸ§  Project Highlights

These milestones showcase my handsâ€‘on experience and technical skills using Microsoft Fabric:

1. **Workspace & Lakehouse Setup**  
   Initiated `PragyaWS` workspace and established `pragyaLakehouse` for organizing all pipeline and transformation artifacts.

2. **Ingestion Pipeline: GitHub to Lakehouse**  
   Built the `tutorial1` pipeline using **Lookup â†’ ForEach â†’ Copy**, fetching data from GitHub and loading into the lakehouse. Data lineage, connectors, and mapping logic captured.

3. **Conditional Pipeline: Azure Data Lake â†’ Lakehouse**  
   Created a secondary pipeline to ingest from Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) with an **if-condition** to ensure data continuity and error tolerance.

4. **Transformation via Dataflow**  
   Constructed a **Dataflow Gen2** transformation targeting the silver layer within the lakehouse using joins, cleanses, and logic chaining.

5. **Parent Pipeline Orchestration**  
   Used an **Invoke Pipeline** approach to orchestrate upstream ingestion pipelines into a consolidated ingestion workflow, bridging raw to silver transitions.

6. **PySpark Notebook: Silver â†’ Gold Transformation**  
   Executed a PySpark notebook in the same workspace to process silver-layer data and save transformed DataFrames as managed tables for warehouse ingestion.

7. **Gold Schema & Managed Tables in Warehouse**  
   Created a warehouse with a `gold` schema by converting silver data into managed tablesâ€”enabling cross-object querying and BI-ready datasets.

8. **Explored AutoML & Data Wrangling**  
   Applied AutoML for model training and used Data Wrangler to perform feature engineering; documented lineage, governance, and metadata handling.  
   *Insert governance/catalog screenshot*

9. **Deployment Pipelines (Power BI)**  
   Configured Power BI deployment pipelines to promote artifacts across Dev â†’ Test â†’ Prod, applying deployment rules to bind models and reports per environment.
